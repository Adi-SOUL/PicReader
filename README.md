# PicReader

A simple script which can help you read scattered pictures

## How to use

```shell
python3 Reader.py
```

**'Use dir'**: choose the directory which contains your scattered pictures

**'Use file'**: choose the content file (it will be generated automatically after you choose your directory for the first time.)

Make sure you have installed all the required libraries.

Up/Right: To the last picture;

Down/Left: To the next picture;

Tab: Enter the page number where you want to go, or give the offset.

for example, if you were on P20, *+50* will take you to P70 and *-19* will take you to P1.
